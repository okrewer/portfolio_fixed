            <p>
              I wanted to create a chair that through the legs scaling up and down 
              gave the illusion of changing angles or perspectives. I had fun playing
              with the different functions and it turned out a little bit different
              but overall happy with it. I think this one turned out much cutier
              than my last. I could imagine it could be deployed in an interactive
              exibit or as a wallpaper.
