I wanted to create a chair that through the legs scaling up and down 
gave the illusion of changing angles or perspectives. I had fun playing
with the different functions and it turned out a little bit different
but overall happy with it. I think this one turned out much cutier
than my last. I could imagine it could be deployed in an interactive
exibit or as a wallpaper.
