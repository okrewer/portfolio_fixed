I did a bit of data viz for another project and I thought that would have helped me but for some reason, this class does not recall that
old info at all! I made my chart a pie chart surround my morning routine. I averaged out the times over a week. Overall fun to think about.
I will say that I am not a fan of using pj5s. I would prefer to learn not in the pj5s environment.
