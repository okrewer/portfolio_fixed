            <p>
            I have a very simple morning routine that is broken up into four activites. See the breakdown of my morning time below.

            <h3>
                Reflection
            </h3>
            <p>
              I did a bit of data viz for another project and I thought that would have helped me but for some reason, this class does not recall that
              old info at all! I made my chart a pie chart surround my morning routine. I averaged out the times over a week. Overall fun to think about.
              I will say that I am not a fan of using pj5s. I would prefer to learn not in the pj5s environment.
