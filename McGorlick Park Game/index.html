            <p>
              I live across from McGorlick Park and get to experience a little big of nature everyday. I get to see trees outside, get the filtered light through my window, and enjoy a nice walk often. These experience are a luxury here in nyc so please come experience them with me! Play my mini-game below and enjoy.

                Reflection
            </h3>
            <p>
              This game was really fun to make! I feel like I learned a lot, like thinking
              through the logic of coding plus game really helped me. I had trouble 
              with understanding the logic of doing two switches at first like how
              would I know which case from which switch I was calling but as they are
              part of a function in a class that doesn't really apply actually. I got
              the basic scene switching working pretty fast but had a hard time getting
              the leaves to move, needed to switch the location of my leaves.move_fish.
              The where certain functions should go sometimes messes me up. Overall I
              am really happy with how the game turned out. I used chatgpt to help
              change the slider color. For the asthetics, I wanted it to feel peaceful
              and gentle. All of the images are taken of McGorlick Park! Even the final
              prize,the photo of my cat, outside the window is McGorlick Park. I would
              want to add prizes for all the levels not just the last one if I got to
              do a round two. Another problem that I would like to fix is rarely there
              is not enough of a certain leaf created to win. I think I would have to
              do the leaves array as three seperate ones in order to make sure each
              had a certain quanity? Or like I would check the leavesarray against
              the goal values and keep making more leaves until the leavesarray had
              more items than all three goal numbers combined. The feedback I got was
              very sweet! People liked how it was relaxing, the asethtics, and how
              there is no way to loose.
