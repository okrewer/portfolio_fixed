              Olivia's head, Kaori's upper, Kristy's lower

            Each function draws a different part of my character, 
              from the torso to the ponytail, allowing for easy customization. 
              I implemented mouse interaction logic with mousePressed() and
              mouseReleased() to toggle their expression and change the background 
              color (makes them mad).

              My character lives in canada and has never had a job. Jobs are not
              of interest to them. They spend their time on altering their hair
              style and getting mad at their friends. Their name is???? Harper?? 
              I will admit, this asignment brought me no joy.
