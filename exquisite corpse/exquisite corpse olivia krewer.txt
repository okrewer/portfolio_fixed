Olivia's head, Kaori's upper, Kristy's lower

Each function draws a different part of my character, 
from the torso to the ponytail, allowing for easy customization. 
I implemented mouse interaction logic with mousePressed() and
mouseReleased() to toggle their expression and change the background 
color (makes them mad).

My character lives in canada and has never had a job. Jobs are not
of interest to them. They spend their time on altering their hair
style and getting mad at their friends. Their name is???? Harper??
