                  We explored what is in a memory of something lost and what qualities could we describe to others. Below is my translation of a lost container of pasta.

                Reflection
            </h3>
            <p>
              partner: Hera Kang
              object description:
               "I’ve lost my lunch, a small, round container filled with pesto pasta
               at the bottom, two cherry tomatoes on the right side in the middle,
               and arugula above. It’s a transparent container with a green lid,
               and the thickness of the lid is like 1/5 of its height.
               Its height is equal to its diameter."
              reflection:
              My partner spoke with some precision about the shape and size of the
              container. I chose to show the circle container from the side view
              which obscures its circle shape. I thought it would make the green
              lid less of an obstruction to seeing the contents. I think the tomatoes
              work well and I found it interesting how they desribes their location
              even though they would probably roll around, but maybe the contents
              are more tightly packed then I imagined! I know what arugula looks like
              but was afraid my attempt to draw in via code would look like nonsense
              and though a standard leaf shape would give across the general idea 
              better.
