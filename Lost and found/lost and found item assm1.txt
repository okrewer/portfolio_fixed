object description:
 "I’ve lost my lunch, a small, round container filled with pesto pasta
 at the bottom, two cherry tomatoes on the right side in the middle,
 and arugula above. It’s a transparent container with a green lid,
 and the thickness of the lid is like 1/5 of its height.
 Its height is equal to its diameter."
reflection:
My partner spoke with some precision about the shape and size of the
container. I chose to show the circle container from the side view
which obscures its circle shape. I thought it would make the green
lid less of an obstruction to seeing the contents. I think the tomatoes
work well and I found it interesting how they desribes their location
even though they would probably roll around, but maybe the contents
are more tightly packed then I imagined! I know what arugula looks like
but was afraid my attempt to draw in via code would look like nonsense
and though a standard leaf shape would give across the general idea 
better.
